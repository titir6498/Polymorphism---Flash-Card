# Polymorphism - Flash Card

I designed a flash card to demonstrate Polymorphism in Object Oriented Programming.
Here, I have treated 'Animal' as the parent class, whose behavior involves speaking. Hence, a function 'Speak' has been defined.

Dog, Cat and Pig are child classes of Animal, as each is a type of Animal. The 'Speak' behavior is demonstrated by different sounds:
1) Dog communicates or speaks using the sound 'bark'.
2) Pig communicates or speaks using the sound 'oink'.
3) Cat communicates or speaks using the sound 'meow'.
